# Pig-Game
Gameplay:
Each turn,a player repeatedly rolls a die until
either a 1 is roller or the player dicides to "hold":

 if the player rolls a 1,they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
 if the player rolls any other number,it is added to their current total and
 the player's turn continues.

the winner is the first player that reach 100.
  
Enjoy :)
